<p>
	Plugins are an important method of customisation for Cuberite. There are many different first and third-party plugins available.
</p>

<p>
	Cubrite plugins are written in Lua, and interact with the server through an
	 <a href="http://api-docs.cuberite.org/">extensive API</a>. They are
	designed to be easy to write for anyone with basic programming experience,
	so if existing plugins don't fill your need you can easily write your own plugins.
	If you want to learn how to write your own plugins, check out
	<a href="http://api-docs.cuberite.org/Writing-a-MCServer-plugin.html">the guide</a>.
</p>

<p>
	Cuberite has a <a href="http://forum.mc-server.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=15">plugin repository</a>
	where you can upload your plugins publicly and download plugins others have
	released. We will cover the use of this plugin repository in the next section.
