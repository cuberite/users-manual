	Cuberite is a Free and Open Source (FOSS) game server compatible with Minecraft Java Edition. Cuberite is designed with performance, configurability, and extensibility in mind, and aims to accurately recreate most vanilla features. The server is written in C++, and there is an extensive plugin system that allows for the user to write their own plugins with Lua. In fact, many of the built in commands are implemented by the Core plugin, which has its own <a href="https://github.com/cuberite/Core">GitHub repository</a> and developer community. For more information on the plugin system and how to use it, as well as how to develop for it, please see {{2.4 - Plugins}}.
