	Cuberite was created in late 2010 by <a href="https://www.fancyaddress.com/">FakeTruth</a> with its original name "MCServer", as a replacement for the vanilla server, designed to be better performing and more configurable. It was later open-sourced, and other developers started contributing.
</p>

<p>
	In the summer of 2013, the main MCServer repository was moved from Google Code to GitHub, and a new build system was introduced. Several new developers also joined the project around that time, and the project began to increase in members and popularity.
</p>

<p>
	As of late 2014, MCServer had a team of more than 10 regular developers, and the codebase had grown to over 125,000 lines (excluding comments, blank lines and external libraries). Many new features were also introduced in 2014:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Chunk Sparsing (ram usage reduction)</li>
	<li>New Redstone Simulator</li>
	<li>New Water and Lava Simulators</li>
	<li>New Generators (and improved speed)</li>
</ul>

<p>
	In 2015, many new developers joined the project, and the community decided to adopt the current name of Cuberite.
	As of late 2015, Cuberite has over 1000 stars on GitHub.

<p>
	2020 marks the 10th anniversary of Cuberite. As a longstanding project, Cuberite's lifecycle has seen several ups and downs. Despite periods of hibernation and developers with busy lives, Cuberite's development still continues thanks to new and old contributors.
