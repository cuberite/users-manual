	Compiling yourself takes longer and is more involved, but on modern processors can lead to a speed increase of up to 1.5 to 3x.
	If your operating system or hardware is not officially supported, compiling may be the only way to run Cuberite.

<ul>
	<li>*nix (Debian, Ubuntu, etc.) users can use the automatic <code>compile.sh</code> script, which is described below.</li>
	<li>All other operating system users (Windows, Mac OS, etc.), and Linux users who are intereted in manually compiling should see <a href="https://github.com/cuberite/cuberite/blob/master/COMPILING.md">COMPILING.md</a> in the main repository.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Compile.sh</h4>
<p>
	This automatic script is recommended for *nix users. It takes care of the compilation process for you.  You only need to copy this command to your terminal:
</p>

<figure class="codebox"><pre><code>sh -c "$(wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cuberite/cuberite/master/compile.sh)"</code></pre></figure>

<p>Compile.sh can also update your server. Re-running <code>Compile.sh</code> from the code directory automatically updates your server by fetching the latest code and then re-compiling.</p>

<aside class="warnbox">
	Compiling takes a while on slow hardware like Raspberry Pis, up to several hours in some cases. However, subsequent compiles will be faster.
