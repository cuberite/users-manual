	Compiling yourself takes longer and is more involved, but on modern processors can lead to a speed increase of up to 1.5 to 3x.
	If your operating system or hardware is not officially supported, compiling may be the only way to run Cuberite.

	The automatic compilation script is recommended for *nix users. 
	The automatic compilation script takes care of the compilation process for you. You only need to copy this command to your terminal:
</p>

<figure class="codebox"><pre><code>sh -c "$(wget -O - https://compile.cuberite.org)"</code></pre></figure>

<p>
	If you prefer to manually compile, or want to compile for Windows, please see <a href="https://github.com/cuberite/cuberite/blob/master/COMPILING.md">COMPILING.md</a> in the main repository.

	This process requires use of the command line. If you are not familiar with it, it is recommended that you use the {{1.1 - pre-compiled builds}} instead.
