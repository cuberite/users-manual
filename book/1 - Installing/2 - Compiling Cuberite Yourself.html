	Compiling yourself takes longer and is more involved, but on modern processors can lead to a speed increase of up to 1.5 to 3x.
	If your operating system or hardware is not officially supported, compiling may be the only way to run Cuberite.

<watwat>	The automatic compilation script is recommended for *nix users. 
	The automatic compilation script takes care of the compilation process for you. You only need to copy this command to your terminal:
</p>

<figure class="codebox"><pre><code>sh -c "$(wget -O - https://compile.cuberite.org)"</code></pre></figure>

<p>
	If you prefer to manually compile, or want to compile for Windows, please see <a href="https://github.com/cuberite/cuberite/blob/master/COMPILING.md">COMPILING.md</a> in the main repository.

<aside class="warnbox">
	This process requires use of the command line. If you are not familiar with it, it is recommended that you use the {{1.1 - pre-compiled builds}} instead.
