<p>
	By default, there are three worlds: <code>world</code>, <code>world_nether</code>, <code>world_end</code>.
	Each world can be tweaked by editing <code>&lt;World Name&gt;/world.ini</code>.
	You can use this file to edit things like the spawn point location, the game mode, and the diffculty level.
	See {{4 - Configuring world.ini}} for details.
