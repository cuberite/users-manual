	Cuberite can be configured by editing various files. Below is a list of all such files:
</p>

<dl>
	<dt>settings.ini</dt>
	<dd>
		The main configuration file, which contains server-wide configuration variables.
	</dd>
	<dt>webadmin.ini</dt>
	<dd>
		Allows you to tweak the web admin interface, which is available at <code>http://localhost:8080</code> or <code>http://&lt;Server IP address&gt;:8080</code> by default.
	</dd>
	<dt>&lt;World name&gt;/world.ini</dt>
	<dd>
		This file configures world-specific aspects. This is where you choose your game mode. See {{3.3 - GameMode}}.
		Note that each world has its own <code>world.ini</code> file, each stored in <code>&lt;World name&gt;/world.ini</code>.
	</dd>
	<dt>monsters.ini</dt>
	<dd>
		Allows you to tweak monster behaviour.
	</dd>
	<dt>motd.txt</dt>
	<dd>
		The Message of the Day, which is shown to players upon joining your server.
	</dd>
	<dt>crafting.txt, brewing.txt, furnace.txt</dt>
	<dd>
		These three files allow you to tweak crafting, brewing, and furnace recipes.
	</dd>
	<dt>plugins/...</dt>
	<dd>
		Many plugins have their own configuration files. For instance, the WorldEdit config is <code>plugins/WorldEdit/config.cfg</code>
	</dd>
	<dt>favicon.png</dt>
	<dd>
		This is the icon that will appear in the Minecraft server list. You may replace it with your own.
		The icon dimensions musts be 64x64.
	</dd>
	<dt>items.ini</dt>
	<dd>
		Edit item IDs. You probably shouldn't edit this file unless you know what you're doing.
	</dd>
