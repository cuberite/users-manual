    This is the Cuberite User's Manual. It is intended as a guide on how to
    operate the basics of Cuberite, as well as an introduction to some advanced
    features. It is organised into major sections as well as more detailed
    subsections and these are laid out in the {{toc - Table of Contents}}.
    The first section deals with downloading, installing, and running Cuberite.
    The second section is an overview of configuring Cuberite. Reading those two
    sections is enough to get you started. The remaining sections cover more
    advanced features and further configuration options in greater depth.
