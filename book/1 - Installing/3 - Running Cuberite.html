	Once you have a compiled copy of Cuberite, with the supporting files (in most cases these are distributed with the executable, in a directory called Server), you can run the server and generate yourself a world. It's easy to run the server, although the method varies depending on the operating system you are using.

<h4 id="runningwindows">Windows</h4>

<p>
	To run Cuberite on Windows, just double click on the executable. A command window will come up, and the world will generate.

<p>
	To run Cuberite on Linux, Mac or FreeBSD, just run the executable in your shell:
</p>

<pre><code>./Cuberite</code></pre>

<h4 id="joining">Joining Cuberite</h4>

<p>
	Just like Vanilla, once you've started Cuberite, you can join the server on <code>localhost:25565</code>, or just <code>localhost</code> in your Minecraft client.
