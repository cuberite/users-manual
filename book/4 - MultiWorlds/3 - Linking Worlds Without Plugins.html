	You can easily link worlds without resorting to plugins by modifying <code>world.ini</code> files.
	However, this method is limited: Each world can only be linked to 2 different worlds.

	By default, the overworld is linked to two worlds: The Nether and The End.
	Stepping through any Nether Portal leads to the Nether, and stepping through any End Portal leads to the End.
	The behavior of Nether and End portals can be tweaked, and you can make each portal type teleport to a world of your choice.
	This is done by editing the <code>[LinkedWorlds]</code> section of each world's <code>world.ini</code> file.
	Note that with this method, you can't make two different portals of the same type teleport you to two different worlds.
	If you want such behavior, you should use a plugin. See the next subsection.
