	For Windows, Linux, Raspberry Pi or Mac builds, the main download location
	is the <a href="https://cuberite.org">official homepage</a>, with the latest
	builds available. For developers who want more control over the builds they
	download, visit the <a href="https://builds.cuberite.org">buildserver</a>.
</p>

<p>
	On Linux, macOS, FreeBSD or Raspberry Pi, you can simply paste this command into your
	terminal to install Cuberite:
</p>

<figure class="codebox">
<pre><code>curl -sSfL https://download.cuberite.org | sh</code></pre>
</figure>

<p>
	Once you have downloaded Cuberite, you can skip straight to
	{{1.3 - Running Cuberite}}.

	Pre-compiled builds are faster to install and easier to use than compiling
	the source yourself, and are recommended for beginners. However, for some
	unusual hardware for which no pre-compiled build exists it may be necessary
	to compile the code yourself. Compiling yourself also has a significant
	performance advantage on modern machines. If you know how to use the command
	line or want extra speed you should {{1.2 - compile Cuberite yourself}}.
