	A chunk is a 16x16x256 segment of blocks. Cuberite performs a save cycle every 5 minutes.
	In a save cycle, all unused chunks are saved to disk and then removed from RAM. Saves cause
	a drop in memory usage. If the number of unused chunks waiting to be saved exceeds 
	<code>UnusedChunkCap</code>, Cuberite will perform an early save cycle to free RAM earlier.
</p>

<p>
	If Cuberite is using too much RAM when the server is under load, lowering <code>UnusedChunkCap</code>
	from its default of 1000 may help significantly. Setting the value to 0 means chunks are always saved
	immediately when they are no longer used. Alternatively, if you'd like Cuberite to maximize performance
	and utilize more RAM, increase <code>UnusedChunkCap</code>.
</p>

<p>
	The effect of <code>UnusedChunkCap</code> will likely be unnoticable on light load, when the cap
	is never being reached and save cycles are being performed in 5 minutes intervals. In contrast to that,
	the effect is often significant when travelling fast and loading many chunks, such as flying
	at high speed.
</p>

<p>
	The optimal value varies depending on settings, system hardware, and playstyle. We currently have no
	official recommended value, and recommend trial and error. A more intuitive setting is planned for the 
	future, where the exact amount of maximum RAM desired is configured.
